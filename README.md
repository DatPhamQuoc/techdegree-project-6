# Techdegree-project-6: Static Node.js and Express Site

 A portfolio build with `Pug`, `Node.js` and `Express`. It includes all my previous projects build from teamtreehouse.com tech degree.

 In this project, `Node.js` and `Express` will be used to:
  * Import the required dependencies
  * Link the `JSON` with the `Pug` templates
  * Set up routes to handle requests
  * Set up the middleware to utilize static files like `CSS`
  * Handle errors
  * Set up a server to serve the project

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project:
 * Run `npm install` to install all project's dependencies
 * Run `npm start` to run the app
 * Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
